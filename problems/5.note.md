# Note of Problem #5

## My answer

I wrote the answer and refined it two times. Though 102/103 testcase has passed by my code, I cannot make the accepted answer without TLE for only one testcase. I'm sad.

I haven't read the solution fully yet but it seems that I should have used Dynamic Programming, which exploit the recursive, to decrease time complexity of my answer more.
