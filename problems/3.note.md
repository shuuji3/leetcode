# Note of Problem 3

I read the solution: <https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/solution/>.
 
 I think the time complexity of my answer is O(1/2 n^2). Tt's better than Approach 1 but using Approach 2: Sliding Window, it can be decrease the time complexity down to O(2n). I'd like to write code using this second approach.
