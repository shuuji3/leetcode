# Note of Problem #4

## Solution

I read [Median of Two Sorted Arrays - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/solution/) but do not understand fully how to find the boundary between the right and left parts with a binary search.

If I'm given the boundary, I was able to come up with the formula to calculate the median same as the description.

## My answer

My answer took the different approach. It's not efficient as much as the solution but more readable one. At first I make a new sorted list concatenating both lists. And just find the median using the list.

I think the space complexity is $O(m+n)$ for a new list and the time complexity is $O(m+n)$. Both complexity is more than the optimal solution but more readable.
